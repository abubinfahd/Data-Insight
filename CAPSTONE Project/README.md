Work on two (2) projects for final assignment. One project should focus
on Data Analysis and the other on Machine Learning. This is an open-ended project that
should capture the two main learning themes of this program. The goal of this project is
to demonstrate my understanding of the covered material, and most importantly,
to demonstrate my technical ability in data science.
